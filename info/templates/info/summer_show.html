		<p>The Northern Indiana Power from the Past would be thrilled to have you at our summer show.  Come for a few hours or stay the whole day.  There is plenty to see and do.  We feature moving displays where you can see real antique farm machinery in action, doing what it was designed to do.  </p>
        
        <p>Each year we choose a different equipment manufacturer to highlight and put those tractors front and center in our display area.  We are ALWAYS an "all color" show and like to have all manufacturers' equipment represented every year.</p>
		
		<p>There are also many interesting stationary displays where you can take your time and look come and get and up close look at what was used in early agriculture.</p>
		
		<p>There are several buildings and outdoor areas are stuffed with flea marketers.  The incredible variety of old and new items they bring to sell is almost overwhelming.  Allow some time to browse them all and bring home a treasure.</p>
		
		<p>What event would be complete without food?  Over a dozen different food vendors are here to serve you something tasty.   Have a no cook day.  Come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
		
		<p>If you’re in the mood for some great music and maybe some dancing, this is your place.  We feature different entertainment daily. Check out the daily tabs on the website to see what we have.  Looking just to relax and watch others perform?  The very popular horse pull, hilarious tractor square dancing, or the classic car cruise-in might be for you.  This is a family show, we didn’t forget about your young ones.  Kids have their own games every day too!</p>
		
		<p>How much does it cost to attend? Not $20, not $15, not $10. No, not even $5.  Only $3.00 for adults and kids under 12 years old are FREE!  The entertainment is even included in this price.  It’s a deal you can’t pass up.  Can’t wait to see you there!</p>
